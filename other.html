<section id="ch1">
<h2 id="section-1">1. SEVIX Service Overview</h2>
<p>This chapter provides a high-level introduction to the SEVIX platform, clarifying its core operational framework—the Broker Model. Understanding this model is fundamental to grasping the unique security, performance, and transparency guarantees SEVIX offers its users.</p>
<h3 id="section-s1-1">1.1 SEVIX Broker Model Overview</h3>
<p>SEVIX operates on a <strong>Broker Model</strong>, a framework fundamentally different from that of a traditional cryptocurrency exchange. In this model, SEVIX acts as a sophisticated technology and interface layer, not as a custodian of assets or a counterparty to trades. </p>
<p>Our primary function is to provide users with a unified, high-performance gateway to the aggregated liquidity and trading engines of major global exchanges, such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit. We do not operate our own order book, matching engine, or asset custody infrastructure. Instead, we integrate specialized third-party services for these critical functions, allowing us to focus on delivering an enhanced trading experience, robust security architecture, and a high degree of transparency.</p>
<h3 id="section-s1-2">1.2 What SEVIX Does (and Does Not Do)</h3>
<p>To eliminate any ambiguity, it is crucial to define the boundaries of SEVIX&#39;s role:</p>
<h4>What SEVIX Does:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provides a Unified Interface:</strong> Offers a single, intuitive platform for trading across multiple liquidity venues.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregates Liquidity:</strong> Connects to top-tier exchanges to provide deep liquidity and competitive pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Facilitates Secure Trading:</strong> Routes orders securely and efficiently to exchange partners via institutional-grade VIP APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Integrates Institutional-Grade Custody:</strong> Leverages Fireblocks&#39; MPC wallet infrastructure to ensure users retain control over their assets.</li>
<li><strong>Offers a Competitive Fee Structure:</strong> Implements a unique rebate system that returns a significant portion of trading fees to users.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What SEVIX Does Not Do:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold or Custody User Assets:</strong> SEVIX never takes possession of user funds. All assets are held in wallets to which only the user has ultimate control.</li>
<li><strong>Operate a Matching Engine:</strong> All trade matching, execution, and settlement are performed by the underlying partner exchanges.</li>
<li><strong>Manage a Central Order Book:</strong> We provide access to the order books of our exchange partners; we do not maintain our own.</li>
<li><strong>Act as a Counterparty:</strong> SEVIX is a technology provider, not a trading counterparty. Your trades are executed against the liquidity of the connected exchange.</li>
<li><strong>Perform Internal Audits of Asset Reserves:</strong> Trust is established through the transparency of our architecture and the verifiable audits of our infrastructure partners (e.g., Fireblocks), not through self-attestation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-s1-3">1.3 SEVIX vs. Traditional Exchanges</h3>
<p>The Broker Model structurally mitigates the single points of failure and custodial risks inherent in the traditional centralized exchange (CEX) model.</p>

<h2 id="section-2">2. Brokerage &amp; Trading Architecture</h2>
<p>This chapter details the technical architecture of SEVIX&#39;s trading system. It explains how the Broker Model is implemented to deliver low-latency, reliable trade execution by leveraging the infrastructure of leading global exchanges.</p>
<h3 id="section-s2-1">2.1 Broker-Based Trading Model</h3>
<p>SEVIX&#39;s trading architecture is designed for performance and security. Instead of building a monolithic system, we have adopted a modular approach that delegates core trading functions to specialized, market-leading partners. Our system acts as a highly optimized routing and communication layer, connecting the user&#39;s trading intent with the execution venue&#39;s engine.</p>
<p>The core of this model is our integration with exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit through their institutional-grade <strong>VIP API</strong> programs. These are not the standard public APIs available to retail users; they are interfaces designed for high-frequency traders and brokers, offering significant advantages in speed and reliability.</p>
<h3 id="section-s2-2">2.2 Orderbook Execution</h3>
<p>All orders placed through the SEVIX platform are executed directly on the order books of our partner exchanges. When a user submits a trade, SEVIX does not match it internally. Instead, the order is securely transmitted to the designated exchange (e.g., Binance), where it interacts with that exchange&#39;s live order book and is matched according to their established price-time priority rules. SEVIX utilizes the order book of external global trading infrastructures through a brokerage structure.</p>
<p>This ensures that SEVIX users benefit from the same deep liquidity, tight spreads, and price discovery mechanisms as traders using the exchange directly. The liquidation, risk management, and settlement logic are also governed entirely by the partner exchange&#39;s robust and time-tested systems.</p>
<h3 id="section-s2-3">2.3 Trade Flow (Step-by-Step)</h3>
<p>The lifecycle of a trade on SEVIX is designed for maximum efficiency and transparency:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Order Creation:</strong> The user creates an order (e.g., limit buy, market sell) on the SEVIX interface.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-Trade Checks:</strong> The SEVIX system performs preliminary validation checks (e.g., format, basic parameters) before transmission.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> The order is signed and transmitted to the target exchange&#39;s engine via a secure, low-latency connection using the VIP API. Our infrastructure is co-located in data centers physically close to the exchanges&#39; servers to minimize network latency.</li>
<li><strong>Order Placement &amp; Matching:</strong> The exchange&#39;s matching engine receives the order, places it on the order book, and executes it against available liquidity according to its internal logic.</li>
<li><strong>Execution Confirmation:</strong> The exchange sends a real-time execution confirmation back to SEVIX.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Trade Update:</strong> SEVIX updates the user&#39;s interface with the trade execution details, including fill price and quantity. The user&#39;s asset balance is updated within their Fireblocks wallet as settled by the exchange.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="section-s2-4">2.4 Price Integrity &amp; Slippage Control</h3>
<p>Price integrity is a cornerstone of our architecture. Since SEVIX does not have its own order book, there is no possibility of price manipulation or artificial slippage being introduced by our platform. The price a user receives is the price determined by the deep, liquid markets of our partner exchanges.</p>
<p>The use of VIP APIs and co-located servers drastically reduces latency, which is the primary cause of slippage in fast-moving markets. By minimizing the time between order submission and execution, we ensure that users&#39; market orders are filled at prices that are as close as possible to what they see on their screen, comparable to the experience of trading directly on the CEX itself.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch3">
<h2 id="section-3">3. Custody &amp; Asset Security</h2>
<p>Asset security is the most critical component of the SEVIX platform. This chapter outlines the multi-layered security architecture, centered on the complete segregation of user assets through our integration with Fireblocks, the world&#39;s leading digital asset custody platform.</p>
<h3 id="section-s3-1">3.1 Custody Structure</h3>
<p>The fundamental principle of SEVIX&#39;s security model is: <strong>we do not custody user assets</strong>. All client funds are held in individual, segregated wallets powered by Fireblocks&#39; institutional-grade MPC (Multi-Party Computation) technology. </p>
<p>This structure creates an unbreakable firewall between platform operational risk and user asset risk. In the event of a compromise of SEVIX&#39;s systems, user funds remain secure and inaccessible, as SEVIX does not hold the private keys or key shares required to authorize transactions.</p>
<h3 id="section-s3-2">3.2 Fireblocks Wallet Architecture</h3>
<p>SEVIX leverages Fireblocks&#39; MPC-CMP wallet infrastructure, which is trusted by global financial institutions, asset managers, and banks for its revolutionary approach to private key security.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC):</strong> Unlike traditional wallets that rely on a single private key, MPC technology eliminates the single point of failure. A private key is never generated or stored in one place. Instead, multiple encrypted &#34;key shares&#34; are created and distributed across different, isolated environments. To sign a transaction, a quorum of these shares must interact through a secure cryptographic protocol, without ever reconstructing the full key. This makes key theft virtually impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Institutional-Grade Security:</strong> Fireblocks&#39; infrastructure is certified with the highest industry standards, including <strong>SOC 2 Type II</strong>, <strong>ISO 27001/27017/27018</strong>, and <strong>CCSS Level 3</strong>. By using SEVIX, traders are entrusting their assets to the same battle-tested security framework used by BlackRock, BNY Mellon, and other major financial players.</li>
<li><strong>User Control:</strong> SEVIX has no authority to move user funds. While our platform can *request* a transaction (e.g., a withdrawal initiated by the user), the final authorization requires cryptographic approval from the user (the asset owner) and is enforced by Fireblocks&#39; policy engine.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-s3-3">3.3 Fund Segregation Principles</h3>
<p>Every user on the SEVIX platform is provisioned with a unique set of wallet addresses within the Fireblocks ecosystem. There are no omnibus accounts where user funds are commingled. This strict segregation ensures: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Ownership:</strong> On-chain data provides a clear and unambiguous record of asset ownership.</li>
<li><strong>Insolvency Protection:</strong> User assets are not part of SEVIX&#39;s balance sheet and are protected from any potential platform-level financial issues.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Transparency:</strong> It allows for straightforward auditing and verification of assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-s3-4">3.4 Asset Movement &amp; Settlement Flow</h3>
<p>The movement of assets is governed by strict, automated protocols that prioritize security and user control.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Deposit:</strong> A user generates a unique deposit address for their SEVIX account. Funds sent to this address are credited to their segregated Fireblocks wallet. SEVIX systems only have read-access to confirm the deposit.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Transfer for Trading:</strong> To trade, funds are moved to a sub-account linked to a partner exchange. This transfer is authorized by the user and executed within the secure Fireblocks environment.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> A user initiates a withdrawal request on the SEVIX platform. This request is passed to Fireblocks, which then requires the user&#39;s explicit approval (e.g., via their mobile device) to sign and broadcast the transaction. SEVIX cannot bypass this user approval step.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="section-4">4. Fee Structure &amp; Rebates</h2>
<p>SEVIX provides a highly competitive trading environment, not only through superior technology but also through an innovative fee and rebate structure. This chapter explains the mechanism that allows users to significantly reduce their effective trading costs.</p>
<h3 id="section-s4-1">4.1 Trading Fee Overview</h3>
<p>When a user executes a trade through SEVIX, the standard trading fee is charged by the underlying partner exchange (e.g., Binance, OKX). This fee is identical to the fee that would be charged if the user were trading directly on that exchange. SEVIX does not add any extra layer of fees on top of the exchange&#39;s standard rates.</p>
<h3 id="section-s4-2">4.2 Rebate Mechanism Explained</h3>
<p>The core of SEVIX&#39;s value proposition is its rebate system. As an institutional partner, SEVIX receives a portion of the trading fees generated by its users from the partner exchanges. Instead of retaining this revenue, SEVIX has built a system to return a significant portion of it directly to the users who generated it.</p>
<p>SEVIX&#39;s rebate structure operates by refunding a portion of the trading fees and is not directly related to investment profits or losses. The rebate is a mechanism based on trading activity and does not guarantee any investment returns. It is independent of market performance or the profitability of trades.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>How it works:</strong>
<br/>1. You trade on SEVIX, generating a trading fee paid to the partner exchange.
                    <br/>2. The partner exchange shares a portion of that fee with SEVIX as part of our partnership agreement.
                    <br/>3. SEVIX calculates your share of this revenue and credits it back to your account as a rebate.
                </blockquote>
<p>This model transforms a trading cost into a revenue-sharing opportunity, directly rewarding users for their activity on the platform.</p>
<h3 id="section-s4-3">4.3 Self-Referral Structure</h3>
<p>The system is often referred to as a &#34;Self-Referral&#34; structure because it effectively allows users to receive the benefits typically reserved for affiliates or introducers, but for their own trading activity. By trading through SEVIX, you are essentially referring yourself and collecting the associated commission revenue.</p>
<p>The conditions SEVIX receives are structurally different from those generally available to the public. This allows users to potentially achieve a more favorable effective fee rate than they might by trading directly on the exchanges, even with high-volume VIP status.</p>
<h3 id="section-s4-4">4.4 Rebate Settlement Timing</h3>
<p>To maximize the benefits for our traders, all rebates are calculated and settled with exceptional speed. Rebates for trading activity from a given day (UTC) are calculated and credited directly to the user&#39;s account on the <strong>following day</strong>. This rapid settlement cycle allows traders to compound their capital more efficiently and provides immediate, tangible feedback on their trading cost savings.</p>

<section id="ch5">
<h2 id="section-5">5. User Account &amp; Risk Boundaries</h2>
<p>This chapter is critically important for legal, risk, and compliance stakeholders. It explicitly defines the boundaries of the SEVIX system, clarifying what actions the platform can and cannot perform in relation to a user&#39;s account and trading activity.</p>
<h3 id="section-s5-1">5.1 Account Structure</h3>
<p>A user&#39;s presence on SEVIX is composed of two distinct but linked components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The SEVIX Account:</strong> This is the user&#39;s identity and configuration layer on the SEVIX platform. It stores profile information, API keys for trading, and preferences. It does <strong>not</strong> store any assets.</li>
<li><strong>The Fireblocks Wallet:</strong> This is the user&#39;s segregated custody layer, where all their digital assets are securely stored. It is controlled by the user, and SEVIX&#39;s access is limited to programmatic, read-only monitoring and transaction *requests* that require user approval.</li>
</ol>
<p>This separation is the architectural guarantee that SEVIX cannot unilaterally access, freeze, or move user funds.</p>
<h3 id="section-s5-2">5.2 What SEVIX Can and Cannot Access</h3>
<h4>SEVIX Can:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Read account balances to display them in the UI.</li>
<li>Transmit user-initiated trade orders to partner exchanges.</li>
<li>Receive and display trade execution reports from exchanges.</li>
<li>Initiate a withdrawal request on the user&#39;s behalf, which the user must then approve.</li>
<li>Calculate and credit fee rebates to the user&#39;s account.</li>
</ul>
<h4>SEVIX Cannot:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Access or export private keys or key shares from the Fireblocks wallet.</li>
<li>Execute a withdrawal or transfer without explicit, cryptographic approval from the user.</li>
<li>Modify or cancel a user&#39;s order without a user-initiated request.</li>
<li>Freeze or seize assets held within the user&#39;s Fireblocks wallet.</li>
<li>Alter the trade execution logic or risk parameters of the partner exchanges.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-s5-3">5.3 Risk Engine Separation</h3>
<p>All critical risk management functions are handled by the risk engines of our partner exchanges (e.g., Binance, OKX). This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Margin Calculation:</strong> Determining margin requirements and available leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Liquidation:</strong> Triggering and executing liquidations when margin thresholds are breached.</li>
<li><strong>Position Risk Management:</strong> Monitoring overall portfolio risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>SEVIX does not run a parallel or overriding risk engine. This complete separation of duties prevents any potential conflict of interest and ensures that all users are subject to the same transparent, market-standard risk rules as everyone else on the underlying exchange.</p>
<h3 id="section-s5-4">5.4 System Limitations &amp; Safeguards</h3>
<p>The SEVIX system is designed with inherent limitations as a safeguard. Our role is strictly that of a technology facilitator. The platform&#39;s architecture makes it technically impossible for SEVIX to act as a principal, manipulate market data, or interfere with the natural process of order matching and settlement. Our trust is built on these verifiable technical constraints, not on operational promises.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch6">
<h2 id="section-6">6. Compliance &amp; Operational Principles</h2>
<p>SEVIX is committed to operating with integrity and adhering to global best practices for financial technology platforms. This chapter outlines our approach to compliance, regulation, and data privacy, designed to build a secure and trustworthy environment without misrepresenting our regulatory status.</p>
<h3 id="section-s6-1">6.1 KYC / AML Policy Overview</h3>
<p>To ensure a compliant trading environment and prevent illicit activities, SEVIX has implemented a robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program. We partner with <strong>Sumsub</strong>, a global leader in identity verification solutions, to manage this process.</p>
<p>By using a specialized third-party provider, we extend our principle of segregation to personal data. SEVIX does not store sensitive personal identification documents (e.g., passports, ID cards) on its own servers. All verification data is securely handled and stored within Sumsub&#39;s compliant infrastructure, which adheres to international data protection standards like GDPR.</p>
<p class="disclaimer"><strong>Important Notice:</strong> SEVIX does not provide its services as an exchange holding a financial license in any specific country.</p>
<h3 id="section-s6-2">6.2 Travel Rule Compatibility</h3>
<p>SEVIX is designed to be compatible with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) &#34;Travel Rule&#34; recommendations. Our integration with Fireblocks and Sumsub provides the necessary infrastructure to securely collect and transmit required originator and beneficiary information for virtual asset transfers when necessary, ensuring we can adapt to evolving regulatory requirements across jurisdictions.</p>
<h3 id="section-s6-3">6.3 Internal Compliance Standards</h3>
<p>Our internal operations are governed by a strict code of conduct that prohibits any employee from accessing or attempting to influence user trading activity. Access to production systems is highly restricted, logged, and monitored. The architectural separation of duties described in previous chapters serves as the primary enforcement mechanism for our internal compliance policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SEVIX has procured a <strong>virtual asset-related insurance policy</strong> regulated in Singapore. This provides an additional layer of financial protection against unforeseen external events, such as sophisticated hacking attempts, demonstrating our commitment to risk mitigation and user protection.</p>
<h3 id="section-s6-4">6.4 Data Protection &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>User data privacy is paramount. Our policy is to collect only the minimum data necessary to provide our service and meet our compliance obligations. As mentioned, sensitive KYC data is segregated and managed by Sumsub. Other user data is protected with strong encryption, both in transit and at rest. We adhere to the principles of leading data protection frameworks, ensuring that users have control over their information.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch7">
<h2 id="section-7">7. System Reliability &amp; Transparency</h2>
<p>The reliability of a trading platform is measured by its uptime, performance, and its operator&#39;s transparency during incidents. This chapter details SEVIX&#39;s approach to building a resilient system and fostering trust through open communication.</p>
<h3 id="section-s7-1">7.1 Infrastructure Stability</h3>
<p>SEVIX&#39;s infrastructure is built on modern, cloud-native principles to ensure high availability and scalability. Key elements of our stability strategy include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Co-location:</strong> Our trading gateways are physically co-located in the same data centers as our partner exchanges. This minimizes network latency to the lowest possible level, ensuring fast and reliable order execution.</li>
<li><strong>Redundancy:</strong> Critical system components are deployed in a redundant configuration across multiple availability zones to prevent single points of failure.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system is designed to automatically scale resources based on trading volume and user load, maintaining performance during periods of high market volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-s7-2">7.2 External Dependency Disclosure</h3>
<p>As a broker, SEVIX&#39;s service is inherently dependent on the stability and performance of its external infrastructure partners. We are committed to full transparency regarding these dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Custody:</strong> Fireblocks</li>
<li><strong>Trade Execution &amp; Liquidity:</strong> Binance, OKX, Bybit, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> Sumsub</li>
</ul>
<p>An issue with any of these core providers may impact the SEVIX service. We proactively monitor the status of all our partners and will communicate any known issues to our users.</p>
<h3 id="section-s7-3">7.3 Downtime &amp; Incident Policy</h3>
<p>In the event of a partial or full service disruption, our policy is to communicate clearly, accurately, and promptly. We maintain a public status page where users can get real-time updates on system performance and any ongoing incidents. Our incident response protocol prioritizes the safety of user actions (e.g., preventing new order submissions if connectivity to an exchange is unstable) and the rapid restoration of full service.</p>
<h3 id="section-s7-4">7.4 Transparency Principles</h3>
<p>SEVIX&#39;s trust model is built on transparency, not blind faith. We believe users have the right to understand the architecture they are relying on. </p>
<blockquote>&#34;We don&#39;t ask you to trust us. We ask you to trust the verifiable, segregated, and best-in-class architecture we have assembled. We provide this documentation and full transparency into our partners so you can make an informed decision.&#34;</blockquote>
<p>This principle guides our product development, operational procedures, and communication strategy. We strive to make our systems and their dependencies as clear as possible to our users.</p>

<h2 id="section-8">8. User Responsibilities &amp; Disclosures</h2>
<p>This section outlines the responsibilities of the user and provides important disclosures regarding the risks associated with trading digital assets. It is essential that all users read and understand this information before using the SEVIX platform.</p>
<h3 id="section-s8-1">8.1 User Obligations</h3>
<p>Users of the SEVIX platform are obligated to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide accurate and truthful information during the KYC process.</li>
<li>Maintain the security of their account credentials and any devices used for transaction authorization (e.g., the device running the Fireblocks app).</li>
<li>Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Understand and accept the risks associated with digital asset trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>The user is solely responsible for the security of their own authentication methods. SEVIX is not responsible for losses resulting from compromised user credentials.</p>
<h3 id="section-s8-2">8.2 Market Risk Disclosure</h3>
<p>Trading digital assets, particularly derivatives, involves a high degree of risk and is not suitable for all investors. The market is highly volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically in a short period. Users may lose their entire invested capital. By using SEVIX, you acknowledge and accept these market risks. SEVIX provides a technology platform for trading but does not guarantee profits or protect against losses from market movements.</p>
<h3 id="section-s8-3">8.3 No Investment Advice Statement</h3>
<p>SEVIX is a technology provider and does not offer financial, investment, legal, or tax advice. Any information, market data, or tools provided on the platform are for informational purposes only. Users should not construe any such information as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular asset. All trading decisions are made solely by the user, who is responsible for evaluating the merits and risks of their own investments.</p>
<h3 id="section-s8-4">8.4 Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, SEVIX shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from: (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the service; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the service, including our exchange and custody partners; (c) any content obtained from the service; and (d) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content. The liability of SEVIX is strictly limited to the scope of the services it directly provides as a technology facilitator.</p>

<h2 id="section-9">9. FAQ</h2>
<h4 id="faq1">Is SEVIX an exchange?</h4>
<p>No. SEVIX is not an exchange. It is a trading platform that operates on a <strong>Broker Model</strong>. We provide a unified interface and technology to access the liquidity and trading engines of major exchanges like Binance and OKX, but we do not operate our own order book, matching engine, or custody assets.</p>
<h4 id="faq2">Who holds my assets?</h4>
<p>You do. Your assets are held in a segregated wallet powered by <strong>Fireblocks&#39; MPC custody technology</strong>. SEVIX does not have access to your private keys or the ability to move your funds without your explicit, cryptographic approval. This structurally separates your assets from platform risk.</p>
<h4 id="faq3">How are trades executed?</h4>
<p>Trades are executed directly on the order books of our partner exchanges (e.g., Binance, OKX). When you place an order on SEVIX, it is securely routed to the exchange&#39;s engine and matched according to their rules. SEVIX acts as a high-speed conduit, not a matching engine.</p>
<h4 id="faq4">How are rebates calculated?</h4>
<p>When you trade, the exchange charges a fee. As an institutional partner, SEVIX receives a commission from that fee. Our system then automatically calculates your share of that commission and credits it back to your account as a rebate on the following day. This rebate is a partial refund of trading fees and is unrelated to market profit or loss; it does not guarantee investment returns. This allows you to achieve a lower effective fee rate.</p>
<h4 id="faq5">Can SEVIX manipulate trades?</h4>
<p>No. This is architecturally impossible. Since SEVIX does not control the order book, the matching engine, or the price feed, we have no technical means to interfere with, reorder, or manipulate trades. All executions are handled by the transparent and publicly audited systems of our partner exchanges.</p>

<h2 id="section-11">Appendix A. Terminology</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Broker vs. Exchange</strong></dt>
<dd>An <strong>Exchange</strong> is a marketplace that operates its own order book, matching engine, and typically custodies user assets. A <strong>Broker</strong> is a technology provider that connects traders to one or more exchanges, facilitating trades without holding assets or matching orders itself.</dd>
<dt><strong>Order Book</strong></dt>
<dd>A real-time electronic list of buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks) for a specific financial instrument, organized by price level.</dd>
<dt><strong>Rebate</strong></dt>
<dd>A return of a portion of a trading fee, paid back to the trader. In the SEVIX model, rebates are derived from the commissions shared by partner exchanges. The rebate structure is a partial refund of trading fees and is not related to investment profit or loss.</dd>
<dt><strong>Self-Referral</strong></dt>
<dd>A term describing a system where a user earns commissions or rebates on their own trading activity, similar to how an affiliate would earn commissions for referring others.</dd>
<dt><strong>Custody</strong></dt>aws
                    <dd>The act of safeguarding and holding financial assets on behalf of a client. In the context of SEVIX, custody is handled by a specialized third-party (Fireblocks), and assets are controlled by the user, not the platform.</dd>
