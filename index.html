            <h1>SEVIX Operational Model & Security Architecture</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: 2025-12-13</p>

            <section id="introduction">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The digital asset market has seen explosive growth, but traders still face the "Exchange Trilemma"—a difficult choice between speed, security, and decentralization. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) offer high speed and deep liquidity, but users must accept the fundamental custodial risk of entrusting their assets to the exchange. Conversely, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) provide a trustless environment but often struggle to meet the performance and scalability demands of high-frequency and professional traders.</p>
                <p>SEVIX was created to solve this structural contradiction. It is an all-in-one trading platform that connects to the world's top-tier exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit through customized VIP APIs, providing a seamless trading service. Users can immediately start trading through a familiar interface, just like on existing exchanges, without the hassle of switching between multiple platforms.</p>
                <p>This document provides a detailed explanation of how SEVIX differs from a typical centralized exchange (CEX) and how its unique "Broker Model," along with the core technology stack that supports it, structurally guarantees the security of user assets and the reliability of trading.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="broker-model">
                <h2>SEVIX Operational Model: The Broker Model</h2>
                <p>The most significant characteristic of SEVIX is that it is not a typical exchange. It operates on a 'Broker Model' by connecting the liquidity and risk engines of Binance, OKX, and Bybit as they are. This means:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Traditional Exchange Model vs. SEVIX Broker Model</strong><br/>
                    A typical exchange operates under the structure: "① SEVIX holds customer funds → ② Processes trades with an internal engine → ③ Requires external audits." In contrast, SEVIX is not structured in a way that it can operate its own risk engine or manipulate it arbitrarily. SEVIX focuses on its role as a broker and interface, while trading and asset custody are performed on proven external institutional infrastructure.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The SEVIX Broker Model is built on two core principles:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Customer assets are not held by SEVIX.</strong> All assets are managed through Fireblocks MPC Custody wallets. SEVIX has no authority over the wallets, and asset control, such as withdrawals and transfers, is conducted according to the custody provider's regulations. Fireblocks is the highest-level security infrastructure used by global institutions (ETF operators, hedge funds, OTC desks).</li>
                    <li><strong>The trade execution/risk engine uses the engines of the exchanges connected to SEVIX</strong>, namely top-tier CEXs like Binance and OKX. Therefore, all trade-related logic, including liquidations, risk management, and position maintenance, is executed according to the exchange's rules.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This architecture structurally prevents SEVIX from arbitrarily misappropriating customer assets or unfairly intervening in the trading process, offering users a high level of transparency and institutional-grade security.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="core-components">
                <h2>Core Components</h2>
                <p>The SEVIX Broker Model is realized by relying on industry-leading external professional infrastructure for its two core functions: asset custody and trade execution. Each component has been selected based on its superior technology and proven reliability.</p>

                <h3 id="section-asset-custody">Asset Custody: Fireblocks MPC Custody</h3>
                <p>SEVIX does not directly hold customer assets. All assets are securely managed through the MPC (Multi-Party Computation)-based wallet infrastructure of Fireblocks, the world's #1 digital asset custody firm.</p>

                <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Control Over Assets:</strong> SEVIX has no information or authority regarding the private keys of customer wallets. Asset deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are executed only with the explicit approval of the asset owner (the customer) and in accordance with Fireblocks' strict security protocols. SEVIX can only request fund movements; the final approval authority rests entirely with the customer.</li>
                    <li><strong>MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Technology:</strong> Instead of creating a single private key, MPC technology generates multiple 'key shares' and stores them in different environments. To sign a transaction, these shares are cryptographically combined to create a signature, drastically reducing the risk of a single point of failure or key theft. The complete key never exists in one place at any given time, making it extremely difficult to hack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional-Grade Security Infrastructure:</strong> Fireblocks is a top-tier security infrastructure trusted by global asset managers like BlackRock, custodian banks like BNY Mellon, and numerous financial institutions. This means SEVIX users receive the same level of asset protection as institutional investors.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="section-trading-engine">Trade Execution & Technical Superiority</h3>
                <p>Instead of operating its own trade execution engine, SEVIX directly integrates the engines of the world's top exchanges, such as Binance and OKX, which boast the highest levels of liquidity and stability. The key technical advantages of this model are as follows:</p>

                <h4>1. Superior Trading Conditions via Top-Tier VIP APIs</h4>
                <p>SEVIX integrates with each exchange using customized VIP APIs, which are exclusively available to top-tier institutional clients, not the public APIs available to general users. This provides SEVIX users with the following exclusive benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Priority Order Processing:</strong> Orders submitted via VIP APIs are given higher priority in the exchange's matching engine, making them more likely to be processed ahead of orders from general API users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced API Rate Limits:</strong> Freed from the strict request limits of public APIs, SEVIX secures much higher rate limits. This allows professional traders who employ high-frequency trading strategies to trade without constraints.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Near-Zero Latency Compared to CEXs</h4>
                <p>SEVIX's systems are co-located in the closest physical proximity to each exchange's servers to minimize network latency. Thanks to direct connections via VIP APIs and an optimized infrastructure, when a user submits an order on the SEVIX interface, it is executed with almost no latency compared to trading directly on a CEX. This provides a decisive competitive advantage for traders who need to capture minute price differences in fast-moving markets.</p>

                <h4>3. Fee Reward System with Globally Unmatched Conditions</h4>
                <p>Leveraging its technical advantages, SEVIX operates a unique Fee Reward System (Self-Referral) that provides users with significantly greater benefits than trading directly on top-tier exchanges like Binance, Bybit, or OKX. This structure is designed to return the majority of the fee revenue SEVIX receives as a top-tier partner from each exchange back to the users.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>How It Works:</strong> When a user executes a trade through SEVIX, a trading fee is incurred. SEVIX receives fee revenue from the integrated exchange based on its partnership agreement and then returns a large portion of this revenue to the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Globally Unmatched Conditions & Next-Day Payouts:</strong> This reward is set at the industry's highest rate (globally unmatched conditions), and the reward for incurred trading fees is settled daily and paid out the very next day. This allows users to effectively trade at the lowest fees available in the market.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Benefits:</strong> This system provides significant cost savings, especially for high-frequency traders, and is a key advantage that directly enhances the profitability of trading strategies. SEVIX goes beyond simply brokering trades; it builds an ecosystem where the platform and its users grow together through active revenue sharing.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="trust-and-security">
                <h2>Trust & Security</h2>
                <p>Instead of issuing a 'self-audit report,' SEVIX builds user trust by transparently disclosing the reliability and security framework of the core infrastructure that constitutes the platform. The subject of the audit is not SEVIX itself, but the external infrastructure providers that SEVIX utilizes.</p>

                <h3 id="section-external-audits">External Audits</h3>
                <p>The security and reliability of SEVIX are objectively proven through the international certifications and audits received by each component of the platform.</p>

                <h4>1. Asset Custody Infrastructure (Fireblocks)</h4>
                <p>Fireblocks regularly undergoes audits by world-class accounting firms (e.g., Deloitte) and security assessment organizations, and has obtained and maintains the following key international certifications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SOC 2 Type II:</strong> The most authoritative certification for evaluating a service organization's internal controls for security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>ISO 27001, 27017, 27018:</strong> International standards for information security management systems and cloud security, demonstrating systematic information asset management and protection capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>CCSS (CryptoCurrency Security Standard):</strong> Achieved the highest level (Level 3) in the international standard for assessing the security of cryptocurrency systems.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Trading Engine Infrastructure (Binance, OKX, etc.)</h4>
                <p>The exchanges that SEVIX integrates with, such as Binance and OKX, already operate within a global top-tier regulatory environment and have strict internal control and risk management systems under the supervision of financial regulatory authorities in various countries. Their execution systems and risk engines are the most reliable infrastructures, proven over years by hundreds of millions of users.</p>

                <h3 id="section-insurance">Additional Asset Protection Through Insurance</h3>
                <p>In addition to technical and structural safeguards, SEVIX further enhances user asset protection by establishing financial protection measures for unforeseen events. This demonstrates SEVIX's strong commitment to risk management and customer trust.</p>

                <h4>1. Virtual Asset-Related Insurance Coverage</h4>
                <p>SEVIX has secured an additional safety net to protect customer assets from unpredictable external threats by obtaining virtual asset-related insurance regulated in Singapore. This insurance serves to compensate for potential customer asset losses that may occur in specific incidents such as hacking or technical failures. This not only proves SEVIX's operational stability and financial soundness but also provides users with a crucial element of psychological comfort.</p>

                <h4>2. Future Insurance Expansion Plans</h4>
                <p>Beyond its current insurance coverage, SEVIX aims to join the insurance programs of top-tier exchanges, such as Binance's SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users) fund, in the long term. This is part of a continuous effort to further solidify the stability of the liquidity pool provided by SEVIX and to build an industry-leading asset protection framework. Through this, users will receive multi-layered protection from almost all types of risks that could occur on the SEVIX platform.</p>

                <h3 id="section-kyc">KYC and Privacy Protection: Sumsub</h3>
                <p>SEVIX uses Sumsub, a global identity verification solution, for its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. This extends the philosophy of the SEVIX Broker Model to the realm of personal data protection.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structural Separation of Personal Information:</strong> SEVIX does not store sensitive customer personal information (such as ID cards, passports, biometric data, etc.) on its own servers. The entire identity verification process and data storage are handled exclusively within Sumsub's secure infrastructure, which complies with international data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Security and Reliability:</strong> This structure means that SEVIX cannot access customers' sensitive information, fundamentally minimizing the risk of data breaches and misuse. Users can trust that their personal information is managed according to the highest industry security standards.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="section-trust-through-transparency">Building Trust Through Transparency</h3>
                <p>Therefore, instead of a self-audited report, SEVIX secures trust by providing transparent information about the infrastructure, security systems, and custody structure it uses.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Instead of saying, "Trust us," SEVIX says, "Trust this proven infrastructure, transparent architecture, and multi-layered insurance system that we use." We provide all information about the technology, security systems, and custody structure we use, empowering users to judge and be confident in SEVIX's stability for themselves.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This approach eliminates the uncertainty of the platform itself and provides structural trust to users by clarifying that the service is built on top of the best-in-market technology and systems.</p>

                <h2>Future Roadmap: Towards Unified Liquidity</h2>
                <p>Beyond its current CEX integrations, SEVIX aims to make all liquidity in the fragmented digital asset market accessible from a single platform. To this end, we are pursuing the following expansion plans:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DEX Integration (Scheduled for Q1 next year):</strong> Starting with the integration of Hyperliquid, the #1 ranked decentralized exchange (DEX), we plan to integrate the liquidity of major DEXs into the SEVIX platform. This will enable users to trade under optimal conditions across both CEXs and DEXs.</li>
                    <li><strong>TradFi Integration (Scheduled for Q1 next year):</strong> To connect with traditional finance (TradFi) markets, we are planning to integrate with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the world's largest derivatives exchange. This will be a significant first step in expanding our trading scope beyond cryptocurrencies to include traditional assets like stocks and commodities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This roadmap shows that SEVIX will evolve into a true 'all-in-one' asset trading hub, encompassing the CEX, DEX, and TradFi markets.</p>

                <h2>Summary: The Role of SEVIX</h2>
                <p>SEVIX is more than just a trading platform; it acts as a 'High-Performance Liquidity Gateway' that unifies the liquidity and infrastructure of the fragmented cryptocurrency market to maximize performance and security. The role of SEVIX can be summarized as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Top-Tier Liquidity Aggregator and Interface:</strong> It integrates the deep liquidity of top-tier exchanges with the institutional-grade security of Fireblocks, providing users with a fast and consistent trading experience (UX) on a single platform through VIP APIs and optimized infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Security Gateway:</strong> By delegating the most sensitive areas of asset custody and trade execution to proven external institutions, it structurally separates and protects user assets from platform risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bridge to Future Financial Markets:</strong> Starting with CEXs and expanding to DEX and TradFi markets, it serves as a bridge that allows users to access all future financial markets through a single gateway.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In conclusion, by entrusting the core functions of trading and asset custody to the most secure and reliable external parties, SEVIX focuses on the technical role of maximizing user experience and trading performance, thereby setting a new standard for the next generation of digital asset trading.</p>
